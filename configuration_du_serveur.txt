1) in Apache config file (for me the path was C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.18\conf\httpd.conf) add the line: Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" in the content of the <Directory> tag:

DocumentRoot "c:/wamp/www"
<Directory "c:/wamp/www/">
    Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    AllowOverride all
    Require local
</Directory>

2) activate the "headers_module" in apache's modules (it will also restart your apache server, effectively applying the change made in step 1)

3) clear your browser cache (I am using chrome and i was told the best way to "hard clear" the cache was to go in the developper tools -> Networks tab -> right click -> clear browser cache) (by the way, clearing the browser cache is often useful when debugging in chrome)

Now it should work. Good luck !
